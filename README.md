Capstone Project

Author: Michelle Viljoen
Project name: Resume Project

Description:
This is a Capstone Project for my software developement studies with CodeSpace. We were required to build a resume website page that showcases our experience, education and skills as well as links to external websites, a form and images. We also needed to make use of a hero header. The page had to be responsive and include at least 3 media queries.
I enjoyed this project and would have loved a little bit more time to perfect some areas but I am happy with my work nonetheless and am proud of this achievement.

I built this website using html and css. I wrote the code on Visual Studio Code and uploaded it to GitHub as the sharing platform with my coach.
